To install this software you must first have a web server that is
configured to run CGI applications. 

The installation process of this software is not automated. It must
be done by hand.

The steps you must perform to install this software are compilation,
web page installation, and binary installation.

These instructions assume that your webserver is installed in 
/home/httpd and that you're using Apache.  You may need to 
account for differences in your web server software installation.

Compilation
-----------
This software has been designed to make use of the GNU build tools.
To compile this software, you must first run the configuration
script.  Next, you must run make to do the actual compilations.
Do this as so:

bash$ ./configure
bash$ make

This software makes use of no special non-standard libraries.  If you
install a Linux system with development tools, you will be able to
build this software with the above commands. If you wish to run this
software on a system with out build tools, you may build it on
another machine and copy it to the system you wish to run it on.
However, it is best to build the software on the system you intend
to run on.

Web Page Installation
---------------------
The installation of the web pages is accomplished by copying the
contents of the html directory in the root directory of this
archive to an appropriate location under your web servers htdocs
directory.

This would be done as so:

bash$ mkdir /home/httpd/htdocs/sample_size
bash$ cp html/* /home/httpd/htdocs/sample_size


Binary Installation
-------------------
To install the binary of this application rename it to .cgi and copy
it to the appropriate web directory. Finally, set the permissions
on the binary file to allow the application to be executed by the
web server.

This would be done as so:

bash$ cp src/sample_size /home/httpd/htdocs/sample_size/sample_size.cgi
bash$ chmod 755 /home/httpd/htdocs/sample_size/sample_size.cgi

Web Server Configuration
------------------------
This section specifically deals with the configuration of a Apache
web server.  You may need to make adjustments to this instructions
if you choose to run with different web server software.

A '-' denotes the old version of text that is modified, a '+' 
indicates the replacement text.  An absence of a prefix represents
a line that has not be changed.

Instructions for Apache v.2.0.x:

	Edit the file /home/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to include the ExecCGI
	directive in its main stanza as so:

	<Directory "/home/httpd/htdocs">
-		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
+		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
		AllowOverride None
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

	Then uncomment the line which invokes the cgi handler for files
	ending in .cgi as so:

-	#AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
+	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

	
Instructions for Apache v.1.3.x:

	Edit the file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to include the ExecCGI
	directive in its main stanza as so:

	# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of
	# permissions.
	#

	<Directory "/var/www/html">

	#
	# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
	# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".
	#
	# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
	# doesn't give it to you.
	#
-	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
+	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
	AllowOverride None
	</Directory>

	Then uncomment the line which invokes the cgi handler for files
	ending in .cgi as so:

-	#AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
+	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi


This is sufficient configuration for the Apache web server.
You may choose to implement restrictions based on ip address
or user name and password.
